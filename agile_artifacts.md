### what challenges did you have ###
git bash was very annoying to install and link (using local vscode)

Time could be more efficiently spent on getting sprints done quicker (I don't feel like i am being productive enough)
### what did you do well ###
not overthinking or doing excess of sprint scope
### What will you do differently next time ###
work more effectively
